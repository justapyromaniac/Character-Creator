# Character-Creator
A character creator for dnd 5th edition

This will eventually be a desktop app to create a dnd 5th edition character based on the standard rules

It uses the CEFSharp library for chromium usage as display
While in the background it uses C# for all the logic required

In the future I may add custom rules and such, but for now it will be a simple desktop app
